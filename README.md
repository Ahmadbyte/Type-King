# Type King:

=> firstly i created the file with the following:
{npx-create-react-app touch-typing-app}

=> Then created the two pages named are:
{Start page} in which when user will open the website then they will see the first page.

=> In Start page it contain the {Start} button and on clicking the start buttonit will redirect them to the start page in which they can start the typing test.

=> On the same page i have added the logo of {TK->Type King} and also added the logo in the tab of the browser.

=> Then i created the secong page named:
{Typing Page} in which user can start there typing test

=> This {Typing Page} will contain the time selection option in which user can select different time
and then {Submit} button to submit the time they have selected.

=> Then i created a {Start} button and on clicking the start button will redirect them to the start page in which they can start the test.

=> Now click the start button which will redirect them to the typing test page.

=> Then inside the typing test page this page contains: 
{Timer} logic in which user can select the time as per users choice.

=> Created a {Timer} which will show the time left for the typing test.

=> Next on same page there i created a random words generator, where users can see the words and type those word and even added the highlighter on the current words which will make user to see properly and can type fastly.

=> Next i created the input box where user can type the words and then i created the logic in which when user type the correct word then the word will be highlighted in green color and when user type the wrong word then the word will be highlighted in red color.

=> Next i created a keyboard in which user when they start typing the words then the key of the keyboard will highlight which shows them that they are typing correctly.

=> Now when user has completed the Typing Test then it will redirect them to the page where users can see there scores like they can see there words per minute types and Accuracy of the typing tests.
