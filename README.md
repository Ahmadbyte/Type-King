# Type King: My Typing Test Project...

=> About:-Type King is a React-based typing game where users can test and improve their typing skills. The game presents a series of random words, and the user needs to type them correctly within a specified time limit. This game helps to improve the typing speed of the user it enhances the typing speed. 

## Here is my Github Link for King Type:

=> {https://github.com/Ahmadbyte/Type-King.git} => Time to time making commit and pushed in the repo.
Created this project and imported every depedencies, Git init then git add . it will add all the file the git commit then made a main branch and then Git push .....This how i pushed my project into Git hub repo.

## Here is my Project Deployed Link for King Type on onrender.com:

=> Then i deployed my project: {Type King} using {onrender.com}.
Here first i have added my project into Github as i explained before then i gave permission to onrender.com to read my project Type King repo and then from onrender.com i deployed my project.

=> Here is my Deployed Project Link:
{https://typeking-f2fr.onrender.com} Here everyone can have access to my project {Type King}.

## Project building start..

=> First of all i created the file with the following:
{npx-create-react-app touch-typing-app}

=> Then created the two pages named are:
{Start page} in which when user will open the website then they will see the first page.

=> In Start page it contain the {Start} button and on clicking the start buttonit will redirect them to the start page in which they can start the typing test.

=> On the same page i have added the logo of {TK->Type King} and also added the logo in the tab of the browser.

=> Also added {background image} in Start page.

=> Then i created the second page named:
{Typing Page} in which user can start there typing test

=> This {Typing Page} will contain the time selection option in which user can select different time
and then {Submit} button to submit the time they have selected.

=> Then i created a {Start} button and on clicking the start button will redirect them to the start page in which they can start the test.

=> Now click the start button which will redirect them to the typing test page.

=> Then inside the typing test page this page contains: 
{Timer} logic in which user can select the time as per users choice.

=> Created a {Timer} which will show the time left for the typing test.

=> Next on same page there i created a random words generator, where users can see the words and type those word and even added the highlighter on the current words which will make user to see properly and can type fastly.

=> Next i created the input box where user can type the words and then i created the logic in which   when user type the correct word then the word will be highlighted in green color which will write {correct} in green color and when user type the wrong word then the word will be highlighted in red color which will write {Incorrect} in red color.

=> Next i created a keyboard in which user when they start typing the words then the key of the keyboard will highlight which shows them that they are typing correctly.

=> Now when user has completed the Typing Test then it will redirect them to the page where users can see there scores like they can see there words per minute types and Accuracy of the typing tests.

=> Also added background image in {Test Page}.


## Features added in the Project:-

=> Used a {Random word Generator} => Generates a set of random words for the user to type.When user enter the Typing Test page then their it contain a set of random word which user has to type in the input box.

=> Created a logic which {highlight the currentWord} => In this The current word which user has t o type is highlighted in light green colour which makes easier for users to see and type.This logic helps the users much and helps to increase the typing speed.

=> Created a {Timing} options which allows users to select the game duration (30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, or 5 minutes).

=> Installed {“react-router-dom”} which helps to enables you to implement dynamic routing in a web app.

=> Used {OnClick} on buttons which can be clicked to navigate to the desired path.

=> Added Start and Stop button in the Typing Test page, which on clicking start it will start the test and on clicking stop it will stop the test.

=> Used a {Countdown} function which start the countdoWn for the time which user has selected 	    for the Test.

=> Provides visual feedback on {correct and incorrect} typing => When user type a certain word and if they are typing correct word then it will show correct word in green colour. And if user type wrong word then it shows Incorrect in red colour.

=> Displays a {Virtual keyboard} for easy typing interaction => In this i made a logic which when typing certain words then the key-board key colour will change to white colour which shows that person is typing correctly or not.They can type without looking into keyboard as in virtual keyboard the key turns to white while typing certain letters.

=> Tracks the user's {accuracy} and words per minute (WPM) upon completion of the game.Users 	      can see their performance after finishing the test.They can see there Word typed per minute and also their Accuracy.
